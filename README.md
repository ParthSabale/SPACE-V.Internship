This is SPACE Robochip.learning to code and build robots virtually using this chip in our internship program.The Space Robochip is a microcontroller which has 7 digital pins. The Pin 0 is also considered as the transmitter pin (Tx) and Pin 1 is also considered as receiver pin (Rx).

# LED Operating

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current is passed through it.In this experiment connect the positive end to digital pin 6 of our microcontroller board. As well as we will connect the negative pin of LED to GND of our microcontroller board. Positive (+) to Digital Pin 6 Negative (-) to GND & Run a code to operate it.

# Ultrasonic Sensors

An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves. Usually a normal ultrasonic sensor will have 4 pins. In order to generate the ultrasound we need to set the Trigger Pin on a High State for 10 microseconds. That will send out an 8 cycle sonic burst which will travel at the speed sound and it will be received in the Echo Pin. The Echo Pin will output the time in microseconds the sound wave traveled.
Experiment Connections:
1) Vcc to 5V of Space Robochip
2) Trig to Digital Pin 5 of Space Robochip
3) Echo to Digital Pin 6 of Space Robochip
4) GND to GND of Space Robochip

# Motor Driver

As the name suggest a motor driver IC or module is used to drive the motors of a robot. We are using it as a kind of protection from high voltages which would damage our microcontroller board which in this case is our Space Robochip. Its because our microcontroller board only require maximum of 5v to run but for motors we need more voltage for its proper working. So we use this driver as a link to carry out both the jobs together, which is the proper working of microcontroller board as well as the motors

# Obstacle Avoidance Programming

# Line Following Control Program

# Joystick Control System

In this experiment we will be building a line follower robot A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), and looks for changes in the field or return signal.
